            "Honorable Mention at Lakehead University's NASA Space Apps 2025 challenge. This web app integrates hourly TEMPO satellite data with ground-based air quality measurements to provide real-time local forecasts. I designed the results sidebar, timelapse preview, and forecast visualizations—transforming complex satellite and sensor datasets into a format that is easy to understand. The app helps sensitive groups, like the elderly and those with respiratory illnesses, quickly assess outdoor air quality risks and make safer decisions.",

Developed using ReactJS and Three.js, it enables users to select a counter layout (straight or L-shape), add kitchen components like cabinets and fridges, arrange them interactively, and experience their designs in Augmented Reality (AR). Models were purposefully kept lightweight for performance and simplicity, focusing on core interaction",
